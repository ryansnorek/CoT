# CoT
**Commitments of Traders report**

Python | Postgres 
+ React web app version

## Introduction
My first personal project after learning to code. This script is designed to reveal large abnormal deviations in positioning of asset managers and hedge funds in the futures market. 

## Successful Predictions
- [ ] Dec 2020: Over 400% increase in long positions on the Energy sector resulting in a multi year bull market
- [ ] 1/18/22 shows leveraged funds increased short positions on the Nasdaq with 23,309 contracts. The total short positions was 98,027 
which is about 200% higher than the 2020 average of 32,166. Since then there has been a large correction in this index

## Other notes
- [ ] Web scraper that pulls raw data from the weekly Commitment of Traders (CoT) futures report
- [ ] Designed algorithms to compare it to average positioning in a postgres database to find deviations from the norm
- [ ] Adjustable percent deviation filter range
- [ ] Selectable year to compare the current report to
